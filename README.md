# Password-Manager
A password manager to generate random 16 character passwords, encrypts it and stores it as an encrypted file.

This app is a password manager which can generate random passwords 
for your different online accounts of 16 letter length.
And then this generated password is encrypted with RSA encryption, 
and stored in your pc. No else can read that as it is encrypted.

The first time you open the app you have to give a master password, 
which will be used to encrypt the generated passwords. 
Once you set it up it cannot be changed.

Keep this master password in mind, if you loose/forget it, 
you cant get back your other passwords.

Do not delete any files inside the password manager folder. 
It might make the app unusable and cant get your passwords back
